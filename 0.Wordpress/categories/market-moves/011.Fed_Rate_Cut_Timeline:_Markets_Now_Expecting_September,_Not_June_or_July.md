# Fed Rate Cut Timeline: Markets Now Expecting September, Not June or July

## Overview

In this comprehensive market update, financial analyst Meet Kevin provides insights on the Federal Reserve's latest statements about interest rate cuts, Morgan Stanley's investment recommendations, Microsoft's strategic adaptation to the Deepseek AI model, and political developments surrounding President Biden's health disclosure. The most significant market news centers on Federal Reserve officials Bostic and Williams suggesting that rate cuts may not come until September at the earliest, pushing back market expectations from earlier potential timelines.

## Fed Rate Cut Timeline Shifting to September

The Federal Reserve has been providing clearer signals about the potential timeline for interest rate cuts, with two key officials weighing in:

1. **Bostic's Concerns About Inflation Expectations**: 
   - Fed official Raphael Bostic broke from Jerome Powell's usual messaging, saying "inflation expectations are moving in a troublesome way"
   - Due to these concerns, Bostic expects only one rate cut this year
   - This contrasts with Powell's consistent message that medium to long-term inflation expectations remain stable

2. **Williams Suggests More Time Needed**:
   - Fed official Williams stated we "probably need beyond June and July to get a clearer outlook"
   - This aligns with the potential for a September first-time rate cut

Markets are adjusting to these statements, now pricing in:
- 93% chance for a rate cut on September 17th
- Only 8.4% chance for a June 18th rate cut
- 37.4% chance for a July 30th rate cut

This represents a significant shift from earlier market expectations that had anticipated cuts as early as June.

## The "Great Hesitation" in Labor Markets

The Wall Street Journal describes what they call a "Great Hesitation" in the labor market, characterized by:

1. **Selective Hiring Freeze**: Companies aren't laying off workers en masse, but have significantly slowed hiring, particularly in permanent positions
2. **IT Industry Contraction**: Despite unemployment dropping from 5% to 4.6%, the IT workforce has shrunk by 5-6%
3. **AI Replacing Entry-Level Jobs**: Entry-level IT and programming positions are disappearing due to AI implementation
4. **Application Screening Challenges**: Job seekers face new obstacles as AI systems screen applications, often rejecting qualified candidates who don't use specific buzzwords

This hesitation reflects a unique labor market situation where mass layoffs aren't occurring, but hiring has simultaneously slowed substantially, creating a state of economic "stasis."

## Morgan Stanley's Investment Recommendations

Morgan Stanley provided key insights for investors in the current environment:

1. **Improving Earnings Revisions**: S&P 500 earnings breath revisions are improving to -5% from -25%, meaning fewer companies are revising earnings forecasts downward

2. **Don't Count On Two Key Catalysts**:
   - A dovish Fed (they don't expect this soon)
   - 10-year Treasury yield under 4% (unlikely without a recession)

3. **Focus on Earnings**: Morgan Stanley suggests earnings are the only reliable driver for market growth in the near term

4. **Sectors to Avoid**:
   - Discretionary goods sectors
   - Small caps
   
   Both are identified as "late cycle poor performers" that typically underperform as economic growth slows

5. **Additional Caution Areas**: Meet Kevin adds that mortgage companies, Enphase, bonds, and Rocket Mortgage are challenging investments without a recession

## Microsoft's Strategic Response to Deepseek AI

Microsoft's approach to the emergence of Deepseek AI demonstrates impressive strategic agility:

1. **Incorporation Rather Than Competition**:
   - Instead of viewing Deepseek as a threat, Microsoft incorporated it into Azure as an option for customers
   - This exemplifies the "commoditization of AI" as Microsoft adapts to market changes

2. **Complementary Strategy With OpenAI**:
   - Microsoft maintains licenses for OpenAI's advanced models for complex queries
   - They're using Deepseek for simpler queries, saving costs while maintaining capability
   - Microsoft added another Deepseek model in March that costs half the price of an equivalent OpenAI model

3. **Cost-Conscious Approach**:
   - CEO Satya Nadella is emphasizing cost-efficiency despite Microsoft's enormous profitability
   - Microsoft reduced general and administrative expenses by 9.1% while growing revenue by 13%
   - The company maintains an impressive 37% net profit margin (compared to Apple's 26%)
   - This "burn the ships" mentality focuses on eliminating unnecessary expenses and products

4. **Strategic Shift on Data Centers**:
   - Microsoft is pulling back on data center development
   - They're treating data centers as real estate assets rather than core business
   - This avoids potential future write-downs if AI chipsets become less valuable

This approach demonstrates Microsoft's strategic vision in adapting to both market conditions and emerging technologies, focusing on their core strengths in software while mitigating potential risks.

## Political Developments

The disclosure of President Biden's cancer diagnosis has triggered political discussion:

1. **Wall Street Journal Editorial Response**:
   - The editorial board criticized Democrats for covering up Biden's health issues
   - They suggest this denied Americans another presidential choice
   - The editorial specifically criticized CNN's Jake Tapper for dismissing concerns about Biden's health

2. **Meet Kevin's Analysis**:
   - While acknowledging the problematic nature of hiding Biden's health concerns, he questions whether Biden's cancer was deliberately concealed
   - He suggests it's more likely that minimal testing was done to avoid finding potential problems
   - Given the timeline of prostate cancer progression, Biden almost certainly had this condition while president

## Summary

The current economic landscape is characterized by:

1. **Fed Rate Cut Expectations Shifting**: Markets now anticipate a September rather than June or July rate cut, with Fed officials signaling the need for more time and data

2. **"Great Hesitation" Labor Market**: Companies are neither hiring aggressively nor laying off workers en masse, creating an economic stasis

3. **Investment Focus on Earnings**: Morgan Stanley suggests focusing on companies with strong earnings rather than anticipating Fed policy shifts or lower Treasury yields

4. **Strategic Corporate Adaptations**: Microsoft demonstrates how top companies are adapting to both a slowing economy and technological changes by emphasizing cost efficiency and strategic positioning

5. **Political Uncertainties**: The disclosure of President Biden's health issues raises questions about transparency and information sharing with voters

These developments suggest that markets may remain in a holding pattern through the summer as investors await more clarity on Fed policy, economic direction, and corporate earnings in Q2 2025.
