# The Tariff Magic Show: America's 245% China Tariffs and the Hidden Interest Rate Strategy

## Overview

The US-China trade conflict has entered a new phase as American tariffs on Chinese goods have escalated from 10% to 20%, then to 54%, 104%, 145%, and now potentially to an astounding 245%. This means a $1 product in the US would cost $3.45 in China. With the US importing $438 billion worth of goods from China last year, this tariff bomb is causing stock market turmoil, rising interest rates, and unexpected economic shocks. Even more surprising are President Trump's attempts to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and rumors of potentially issuing a "super bond" with a 100-year maturity. This article examines the real purpose behind what has evolved from a simple trade war into an economic war, and the hidden strategy behind these seemingly chaotic moves.

## The Magician's Choice: What's Behind the Tariff Policy

In the world of magic, there's a concept called "equivocay" or "magician's choice." It's a technique where the magician appears to give the audience free choice, but in reality, the outcome is predetermined regardless of what choice is made. The current US tariff policy bears similarities to this magical technique.

On the surface, several potential outcomes are being pursued:
1. Pressuring other countries to lower their tariffs to achieve fair trade
2. Bringing high-skilled manufacturing jobs back to America to strengthen domestic production
3. Isolating China to reduce the trade deficit
4. Causing economic slowdown to control inflation and decrease essential goods prices

However, behind all these visible goals might be a true hidden purpose: **lowering interest rates**.

## Why Are Lower Interest Rates Important?

What the US may really want is lower interest rates, and the reason is straightforward:

1. **National Debt Refinancing**: About $9 trillion of US national debt is coming due in 2025 alone. Refinancing this debt at current high interest rates would potentially drain the budget with interest payments alone.

2. **Economic Stimulation**: Lower interest rates encourage borrowing by businesses and individuals, stimulating economic activity. This is how President Trump built his real estate empire – borrowing and investing in a low-interest-rate environment.

Yet the bond market is currently moving in the opposite direction. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4%, leading to higher costs for mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, and all types of borrowing.

## The Attempt to Fire Jerome Powell: An Unprecedented Move

On April 17, 2025, President Trump stated, "Termination of Jerome Powell cannot come fast enough." No Federal Reserve chair has ever been fired in history. Legally, the president cannot dismiss the Fed chair over policy disagreements, only for misconduct or illegal actions.

Powell's term runs until 2026, but the Trump administration is reportedly exploring workarounds, such as reassigning Powell to a different role or appointing a "shadow Fed chair." Scott Bessent is mentioned as a potential candidate for this role.

The fundamental reason behind Trump's desire to remove Powell is clear: Powell believes the economy is stable and isn't rushing to lower interest rates, which conflicts with Trump's goal of returning to "0% rates."

## The "Super Bond": A Potential 100-Year Treasury

Rumors suggest the US government is considering issuing a "super bond" – a treasury bond with a 100-year maturity. If issued in 2025, it wouldn't be repaid until 2125, essentially passing the debt burden to future generations.

The advantage of this strategy is avoiding refinancing short-term debt in the current high-interest environment. However, a crucial question remains: In today's unstable economic climate with inflation uncertainty, who would be willing to lend money to the US government for 100 years?

## Market Reaction: Fear and Uncertainty

These developments are having a significant impact on markets:

1. **Stock Market Plunge**: The S&P 500 has experienced a major decline, wiping out trillions of dollars in market value. Companies like Nvidia have lost over $100 billion in market capitalization in a single day.

2. **Fear Index Rising**: The VIX, Wall Street's fear and greed index, has climbed into the 40s and briefly reached the 50s – indicating market panic.

3. **Bond Market Chaos**: The typically stable bond market is showing stock-like volatility. Short-term rates are falling while long-term rates are rising, suggesting the market is demanding additional compensation for inflation and uncertainty.

4. **Flight to Safety**: Investors are moving out of risky assets and into safe havens like the US dollar, short-term Treasuries, and gold.

## Advice for Investors

How should individual investors respond during these uncertain times?

1. **Maintain Long-Term Investments**: Continue dollar-cost averaging into ETFs like VTI that represent the entire US market. In the long run, markets tend to rise, and major drops can present buying opportunities.

2. **Consider Bitcoin Investments**: If paper money systems are a government illusion, Bitcoin may be an alternative that cannot be manipulated. Market fear that drives Bitcoin prices down may present buying opportunities.

3. **Stay Calm**: No one, not even the government, knows for certain how this situation will end. The most important thing is to maintain composure and continue investing from a long-term perspective.

## Summary

America's tariff policy against China may appear to target trade imbalances, manufacturing job repatriation, and national security enhancement, but behind these visible goals may lie a strategy to induce interest rate cuts. The Trump administration seems to be using various methods – from attempting to fire the Federal Reserve chairman to considering super bond issuance – to create an environment conducive to lowering interest rates and refinancing national debt.

This situation resembles the "equivocay" technique used by magicians, where the audience is shown multiple possibilities while being led toward one predetermined outcome. The extreme scenario of tariffs rising to 245% could ultimately lead to economic slowdown and lower inflation, providing the Fed with justification to cut interest rates.

For investors, the key is not to become perplexed spectators of this magic show, but to maintain a long-term investment strategy and view market downturns as buying opportunities.
