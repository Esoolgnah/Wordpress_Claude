# Nuclear Power's Uncertain Renaissance: The Reality Behind Small Modular Reactors and Tech Industry's Energy Demands

## Overview

The nuclear industry has long promised a renaissance that would deliver abundant, clean, and affordable energy. In recent years, this narrative has gained renewed momentum with the rise of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and growing energy demands from tech giants powering AI and data centers. This article examines the current state of nuclear power, exploring whether we're genuinely witnessing a revival or just another cycle of ambitious promises. By analyzing the economics, practical challenges, and competing renewable technologies, we'll assess the role nuclear energy might realistically play in our future energy mix as countries race to achieve net-zero emissions.

## The Reality of Nuclear's Current Position

Despite frequent claims of a nuclear renaissance over the past 25 years, the data tells a different story:

> "Since 2000, some 120 reactors or so have come online. In the same period, that same number of reactors have been shut down permanently. If you look at the share of electricity produced in the world, that was around 17% in the mid-1990s. Today, it's only 9%. This is not what a new nuclear renaissance looks like."

World leaders have recently made pledges to triple nuclear capacity, but as one expert in the documentary notes, "So far it's just words, and for a nuclear revival, we will need more than words. We need to build right."

The history of nuclear "revivals" shows a consistent pattern: grand announcements followed by minimal actual construction. For example, in the early 2000s, both the UK under Tony Blair and the US under George W. Bush promoted a nuclear revival:

> "There were about 30 reactors ordered by utility companies around the United States. In fact, only four of them went into construction, and of those four, two of them were abandoned after about $9 billion were spent."

## Small Modular Reactors: Promise vs. Reality

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are being positioned as the solution to traditional nuclear's cost and time overruns. Paul Stein, founder of Floral Energy Limited and former chair of Rolls-Royce's SMR business, explains the concept:

> "A small modular reactor is one that is a shrunken version of a large reactor but with some important differences, and the most important difference is it's constructed in a modular fashion, which reduces the capital cost. So, it means all the parts of the reactor can be built in a factory environment, can be brought to site, bolted together on site, and that dramatically reduces the time to getting power on grid and the capital cost of the equipment."

However, there's an important catch:

> "The 'small' in small modular reactors actually is now misleading... Most of the practical SMR designs that are available today are in the 300 to 500 megawatt class. That's not small—that's powering a town the size of Leeds."

When asked how many SMRs are actually operating in the world today, Stein acknowledges: "Right now, there are no SMRs operating in the world today. They're all under development."

There are still significant questions about the cost-effectiveness of SMRs. While they should be less expensive in absolute terms compared to major projects like Vogtle (which cost about $37 billion) or Hinkley Point C, engineering knowledge and past experience suggest that on a per unit of power capacity basis, a small reactor will typically be more expensive than a large reactor due to the loss of economies of scale.

## The Micro Nuclear Option

Some companies are pursuing even smaller nuclear solutions. Michael Crab of Last Energy is developing micromodular nuclear power plants:

> "What Last Energy has done is designed that power plant and that nuclear island, which has the nuclear reactor, to be mass manufacturable. So our product is ultimately a 20 megawatt power plant versus SMRs, small modular reactors, which tend to be 300 megawatts or so."

These units cost approximately $100 million each (about £80 million), with the key advantage being that institutional investors can more readily invest in projects of this size.

However, critics remain skeptical of these unproven technologies:

> "I wish all nuclear startups all the best, but I think we should be realistic here. We are talking about nuclear power that doesn't exist yet. It exists in PowerPoint... In any PowerPoint presentations, these nuclear reactors look wonderful. They're clean and they're efficient and they're cheap and easy to build, right? We haven't seen these reactors in action. We're being a little bit naive if we believe the industry hype."

## Tech Industry's Growing Energy Demands

A significant driver behind renewed interest in nuclear power is the surging energy demand from technology companies, particularly for data centers and AI:

> "One AI query consumes 10 times as much energy as a standard Google search. The hyperscale data centers can require as much electricity per year as something like 400,000 electric cars."

Major tech companies are actively pursuing nuclear power options:

- Microsoft is trying to reopen Three Mile Island, signing a deal to buy power from the previously closed reactor
- Amazon has agreed to pay about $650 million to put a data center near a nuclear site in Pennsylvania
- Google was among the first to step into this world by ordering power from small modular reactors
- Facebook has also made moves into this area, though plans have faced environmental and regulatory challenges

This trend reflects the tech industry's need for stable, reliable power sources as AI applications drive unprecedented energy consumption. However, recent research from Deepseek suggests AI could potentially become more efficient and less energy-intensive than initially predicted, adding uncertainty to long-term demand projections.

## The Nuclear Industry's Credibility Problem

One major challenge facing nuclear power is its historical failure to deliver on promises of cost and construction timelines:

> "I think the nuclear industry has a bad name because it has wasted so many taxpayer dollars over time, and no one has ever apologized for it. If you go $10 billion over budget and 10 years over schedule and you do it on the ratepayer or the taxpayer's dime, you can't turn around and celebrate that like a huge success. It's incredibly offensive to people who are working hard to make ends meet."

This has led to calls for greater accountability from the industry:

> "I think the nuclear industry needs to deliver, and it is our responsibility. We need to stop blaming other people and stop blaming history... and really take accountability for delivering."

## Nuclear vs. Renewables: The Time and Cost Equation

A fundamental challenge for nuclear power is the extended timeline required for deployment compared to renewable alternatives:

> "The average nuclear plant takes about 10 years between the time you start pouring concrete in the ground and it starts generating power and supplying it to the grid. But usually there's another period of five or 10 years that is required to get the environmental clearances... finding a community that is willing to live near this very risky site, and last but not least, to raise the tens of billions of dollars you need. Whereas renewables can be built much more quickly."

This time difference has significant implications for addressing climate change:

> "When you put money into nuclear power, you're not only starving renewables, you're also making it so much later for the emission reductions to happen."

Dale Vince, founder of UK green energy supplier Ecotricity, emphasizes this point:

> "Take a windmill, for example. We could build it from scratch. We could find a piece of land that's suitable for a windmill, and we could build it within 12 months. Six months later, it's broken even on a carbon footprint basis. All of the carbon used in its manufactured, transport, and installation is wiped out. That's 30 years with the nuclear power station. 18 months or 30 years, we've got an abundance of wind and sun that would never run out."

## The "Dunkelflaute" Challenge

One key argument made for nuclear power is its ability to provide stable baseline power when renewables cannot. The German term "Dunkelflaute" describes periods when it's dark and there's low wind—a worst-case scenario for renewable energy.

Supporters of nuclear power point to actual events that demonstrate the need for reliable baseline power:

> "On the 22nd of January this year, the wind didn't blow and the sun didn't shine. So, we were dependent for a mixture of gas at 70% on the grid. And nuclear is about 15% on the grid. Bit of biomass and some imports mainly from France. That tells you that you need to plan for there not to be any wind and not to be any sun."

However, renewable advocates argue that this challenge can be addressed through grid interconnections and energy storage:

> "It's very rare for there to be no wind everywhere for very long at all. Remember that we're interconnected in Europe with grid connections from one country to another. And we regularly ship power to where it's needed from where we have more than we need. Wind moves in broad fronts across the continent. We can see it coming."

The current limitations of energy storage present a significant challenge:

> "Right now in the UK, we have just over 30 gigawatt hours of storage. And that roughly means we can power the entire UK for about 1 hour on stored energy. Yes, that will increase over the coming while, but it's not going to increase by a factor of 10."

## Nuclear Safety and Public Perception

Public perception of nuclear risk remains a major barrier to expanded deployment. The documentary addresses this by examining major nuclear incidents and their actual impacts:

On Three Mile Island: "The radiation released at Three Mile Island was equivalent to the radiation you would be exposed to if you go to the dentist and have a photo taken of your teeth."

On Fukushima: "There were three meltdowns, and we know from two reports produced by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the effects of atomic radiation that there was no increase in cancer, there was no increase in heart disease, or there was no increase in birth defects, nor do the experts expect such an increase."

On Chernobyl: "Chernobyl was a very, very different accident from a typical meltdown. Chernobyl wasn't even a meltdown. It was a blowup... The current death toll stands at a couple dozen people who were hospitalized soon after the events and whose treatment for acute radiation sickness failed."

However, critics argue that focusing solely on immediate deaths misses the broader impact:

> "It's not just the number of deaths that we should be worried about. For those people who are living near Chernobyl, for example, many of them live with the daily fear that they are going to be diagnosed with cancer at some point. There's a lot of stress, there's a lot of uncertainty... Many of the people who have developed thyroid cancers, and there were thousands of people who developed those thyroid cancers, they have to take drugs, they have to remove their thyroid. It's not a nice life, right? So you cannot just measure based on numbers of deaths."

## The Promise of Nuclear Power

The documentary concludes by asking various experts about the original promise of nuclear power and whether it will be achieved.

One nuclear advocate describes it as "one of the most precious sources of energy ever gifted to humankind because it is very energy dense. It's low carbon in a world where that is really important, and it can be made cost effective." When asked if that promise will be achieved, he responds: "Yes, I do. I think that promise will be achieved, and it will certainly be achieved in my lifetime and probably the viewers' lifetime."

A nuclear critic offers a sharply different perspective:

> "The promise of nuclear power has always been, from day one, power so cheap that we won't even meter it. I would say all of the promises of nuclear power have been broken, smashed to pieces. They're lying on the floor. I don't understand how that has any credibility at all."

## Summary

The current state of nuclear power presents a complex picture with several key insights:

1. **Historical context matters**: Despite decades of promised "nuclear renaissance," the global share of nuclear power has actually declined from 17% in the mid-1990s to 9% today.

2. **SMRs remain unproven**: Small Modular Reactors are presented as the future of nuclear power, but none are currently operational, and they may face the same cost and timeline challenges as traditional plants.

3. **Tech industry demand is driving interest**: Major tech companies are increasingly turning to nuclear power to meet growing energy demands from data centers and AI applications.

4. **Time is a critical factor**: Nuclear projects typically take 15-20 years from planning to operation, while renewables can be deployed in months to a few years—a crucial difference when trying to rapidly reduce carbon emissions.

5. **Trust deficit persists**: The nuclear industry continues to struggle with public perception and a track record of cost overruns and delays that have undermined its credibility.

6. **Renewable integration challenges**: While renewable energy offers faster deployment and falling costs, challenges remain in providing consistent power during periods of low wind and sun.

7. **The debate is emotionally charged**: Nuclear power remains highly divisive, inspiring both passionate advocacy and forceful opposition, often transcending purely technical or economic considerations.

The path forward remains uncertain, but what is clear is that any meaningful nuclear revival will require more than just promises—it will need demonstrated success in building plants on time and on budget, credible solutions to waste management, and the ability to compete economically with rapidly improving renewable technologies.
