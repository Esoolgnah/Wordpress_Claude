# The New Phase of US-China Economic War: China's Treasury Bond Selloff and Its Impact

## Overview

China has begun implementing the "nuclear option" of selling off US Treasury bonds, signaling a new phase in the US-China trade war. After President Trump imposed a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, China responded with a 125% retaliatory tariff on all US goods. However, the more significant development is China's decision to sell US Treasury bonds. This article explores why movements in the bond market are crucial, how they affect everything from mortgage rates to 401(k)s, and why this might be part of a larger strategy rather than just retaliation—potentially similar to how the US cornered the British pound in the 1990s.

## What's Happening?

In early April 2025, something unusual occurred in the bond market: a large-scale selloff of US Treasuries. The interest rate (yield) on the 10-year Treasury bond increased significantly, which is concerning for the US economy. Investors believe that foreign countries, particularly Japan and China—the two largest holders of US debt—are dumping Treasury holdings in response to President Trump's tariffs.

China has been gradually reducing its US debt holdings for years. By the end of 2024, China's US debt holdings had fallen to approximately $760 billion, the lowest level since 2009. This entire situation was triggered by tariffs:

- April 9, 2025: President Trump imposes 104% tariffs on all Chinese imports
- China retaliates with 50% tariffs on US goods (bringing total to 84%)
- Trump escalates to 145% tariffs
- China responds with 125% tariffs

All these tariff escalations occurred within just one week. However, China's response went beyond tariffs. They also:

1. Filed complaints with the WTO
2. Placed restrictions on 18 American companies
3. Limited exports of rare earth materials
4. Most significantly, began selling US Treasuries

## Why Is the Bond Market So Important?

The bond market is powerful enough to influence interest rates, central bank actions, stock markets, and even presidential decisions. While most people believe the Federal Reserve (Fed) sets interest rates, in reality, the Fed only controls short-term rates like the overnight lending rate between banks. Long-term rates, such as the 10-year Treasury yield, are determined by market forces—buyers and sellers.

When countries like China sell bonds, the Fed cannot immediately stop the process. As bonds are sold off, their prices fall and yields rise. Here's a simple example:

- If a $1,000 bond pays $50 annually, that's a 5% yield
- If the bond price drops to $900 but still pays $50, the yield increases to 5.5%

When China and other foreign governments sell hundreds of billions in bonds simultaneously, US yields are forced higher, causing interest rates to rise. This is exactly what we're seeing now.

Higher yields make borrowing more expensive for the US government. With over $30 trillion in national debt, this creates significant problems. If interest rates rise too quickly, parts of the US economy may break down, forcing deleveraging. This pressure recently compelled President Trump to pause tariffs for 90 days to prevent further economic damage.

## Scott Bessent's Strategy

Scott Bessent, President Trump's Treasury Secretary, was a key figure alongside George Soros in "breaking" the Bank of England in the early 1990s. At that time, the UK was part of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), which required maintaining the pound's value within a specific range against the Deutsche Mark.

The UK defended the pound by raising interest rates and using foreign reserves. However, the UK economy was weak, inflation was high, unemployment was rising, and interest rates were already too high for the economy to handle.

Bessent and Soros realized the UK couldn't sustain this position indefinitely. They believed the pound was overvalued and that the UK would eventually have to either devalue the currency or leave the ERM. They shorted the British pound, borrowing and selling pounds while betting they could buy them back later at a lower price.

Despite the Bank of England's attempts to defend the pound by raising interest rates and using reserves, Bessent and Soros continued selling. On September 16, 1992—known as "Black Wednesday"—the UK withdrew from the ERM, the pound crashed, and Soros made over $1 billion from the trade.

## The Connection to China

The current situation with China may resemble what happened with the UK in the 1990s. Scott Bessent appears to be creating a scenario where China must choose between two difficult options:

1. **Weaken the yuan**:

   - Pro: Makes exports cheaper, offsetting the impact of Trump's tariffs
   - Con: Creates inflation in China, potentially triggering capital flight as investors move money out of the country, increases borrowing costs, and could destabilize China's financial system

2. **Defend the yuan**:
   - Method: Sell US dollar reserves to buy yuan
   - Result: Requires selling US Treasury bonds, pushing US interest rates higher and pressuring the US economy

China is currently choosing the second option. While this looks like retaliation against the US, it's also a necessary measure to protect China's own financial system from collapse.

The key question becomes: How long can China defend its currency before running out of dollars? Conversely, how long can the US tolerate high interest rates before its economy enters a recession, especially considering it needs to refinance $9 trillion in debt in 2025?

## Potential Outcomes

If China continues selling US Treasuries, several outcomes are possible:

1. Rising US interest rates, making mortgages, credit cards, and car loans more expensive
2. Federal Reserve intervention through Treasury purchases to stabilize the bond market (essentially QE 2.0)
3. Worst case: Complete financial decoupling where the US and China stop trusting each other's currencies entirely

## Advice for Investors

Despite the uncertainty, long-term investors should remain invested:

1. Maintain dollar-cost averaging into index funds like Vanguard's VTI
2. Continue dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin
3. Avoid trying to time the market
4. Focus on understanding the bigger picture to maintain investment discipline during volatile periods

## Summary

China's selloff of US Treasury bonds represents more than simple retaliation—it may be part of a complex economic strategy. Scott Bessent appears to be applying pressure on China similar to the strategy used against the British pound in the 1990s. China faces the difficult choice between weakening its currency or defending it at the cost of selling US Treasuries.

This situation is significantly impacting the US bond market and interest rates, which affects mortgage rates, stock market volatility, and ultimately the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions.

As an investor, the key is to maintain a long-term investment plan rather than reacting to short-term market fluctuations. Through dollar-cost averaging and diversification, you can continue building wealth even during these uncertain times.
