# 9 Ways to Make Passive Income Generating $27,000 per Week: Ali Abdaal's Realistic Guide

## Overview

In this video, doctor and popular YouTuber Ali Abdaal explains in detail the nine passive income methods he actually uses. He rates each method on a 5-point scale based on how difficult it is to start, how hard it is to make $100 per month, and how challenging it is to maintain once the system is set up. Ali's business currently generates about $27,000 per week (around $108,000 per month) through these various passive income streams, but he emphasizes that this is the result of consistent effort over eight years.

## The Reality of Passive Income

Ali first clarifies the misconception about 'passive income':

> "I always put 'passive income' in quotation marks because there is really no such thing as completely passive income. There's no way to make money without doing anything at all."

What he means by passive income is 'money that is not directly tied to your time.' For example, writing a book once and then receiving royalties every time the book sells. The essence of passive income is creating value once and then continuously receiving compensation for that value.

Ali also emphasizes that generating passive income always takes a long time:

> "If you're looking for a get-rich-quick scheme, those things just don't exist. So you might as well not even try."

Ultimately, money is just a medium for exchanging value, and the only way to make money is by providing value. The way to earn passive income is to provide value in a way that is not directly tied to your time.

## 9 Ways to Generate Passive Income

### 1. Investing in Stocks and Shares

- **Difficulty to start**: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)
- **Difficulty to make $100/month**: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
- **Difficulty to maintain**: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)

Investing in stocks is the easiest way to earn passive income. Ali recommends index funds like the S&P 500 for beginners. On average, the S&P 500 has a return of about 10% annually, so to earn $100 per month ($1,200 per year), you would need to invest around $12,000.

However, considering the compound effect:

- If you invest $7,500 in the S&P 500 and leave it for 5 years, you'll be earning about $100 per month after 5 years.
- If you invest $5,000 and wait 10 years, you'll similarly earn about $100 per month.

Ali has been investing in stocks since 2015, and his portfolio is now worth around $350,000, generating approximately $682 per week in passive income.

### 2. Starting a YouTube Channel

- **Difficulty to start**: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)
- **Difficulty to make $100/month**: ★★★★☆ (4/5)
- **Difficulty to maintain**: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)

Starting a YouTube channel is easy, but growing it is difficult. To be eligible for YouTube monetization (YPP), you need 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time. Ali reached his first 1,000 subscribers after uploading 52 videos over six months, and on average, it takes about 90 videos to reach this milestone.

On YouTube, you earn about $2 per 1,000 views, so to make $100 per month, you need 50,000 views per month. Assuming you upload one video per week, each video would need about 12,500 views. This typically happens when you have around 62,000 subscribers.

Ali's YouTube channel currently generates about $12,000 per month in ad revenue, which is about $3,000 per week. Most of this comes from older videos rather than recently uploaded ones.

### 3. Starting a Podcast

- **Difficulty to start**: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)
- **Difficulty to make $100/month**: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
- **Difficulty to maintain**: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)

Starting a podcast is easy, but growing it is harder than growing a YouTube channel. Podcasts primarily earn revenue through brand sponsorships, as there's no ad revenue system like YouTube. For a 60-second ad, you can receive about $25 per 1,000 downloads.

To make $100 per month, you need about 1,000 downloads per episode (assuming a weekly podcast). Only the top 20% of podcasts worldwide get more than 1,000 downloads per episode.

Ali and his brother's podcast 'Not Overthinking' generates about $625 per week through brand deals and memberships.

### 4. Affiliate Marketing

- **Difficulty to start**: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)
- **Difficulty to make $100/month**: ★★★★☆ (3.5/5)
- **Difficulty to maintain**: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)

Affiliate marketing involves selling other people's products and receiving a percentage of the sales as commission. Signing up for affiliate programs like Amazon Associates is easy, but you need traffic to actually earn revenue.

For example, if you receive a 5% commission on a $50 product with a 1% conversion rate, you would need 8,000 visits to make $100 per month.

Globally, 48% of affiliate marketers earn $20,000 per year ($1,660 per month). Ali earns about $11,000 per month ($2,750 per week) through Skillshare's affiliate program and about $450 per month through Amazon.

### 5. Selling Digital Products

- **Difficulty to start**: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)
- **Difficulty to make $100/month**: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
- **Difficulty to maintain**: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)

Digital products are products you create once and can sell multiple times (e.g., e-books, icon sets, apps, website themes). Anyone can write an e-book, but getting people to actually buy it is a more challenging task.

Ali mentions a designer he follows on Twitter named Traf, who created an iOS 14 icon set, sold it for $30 each, and made about $300,000 in a few weeks. Another example is his YouTuber friend Oliur, who has made about $700,000 selling Tumblr website themes since 2014.

To get people to pay you:

1. Identify their problem
2. Provide a solution to that problem
3. Charge for that solution

### 6. Creating an Online Course

- **Difficulty to start**: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)
- **Difficulty to make $100/month**: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
- **Difficulty to maintain**: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)

Online courses are a type of digital product but are typically delivered in video format. You can create an online course with just a smartphone. The key is that the course must be genuinely good for people to pay for it.

You can sell online courses through platforms like Skillshare. To make $100 per month on Skillshare, you need about 28 hours of watch time, which means about 28 students watching your 1-hour course each month.

Another approach is to sell your course for $100, so you only need one sale per month to make $100.

Ali earns about $60,000-$65,000 per month ($15,000 per week) through Skillshare, which is the largest portion of the $27,000 weekly passive income his business generates.

### 7. Creating a Paid Membership or Community Model

- **Difficulty to start**: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)
- **Difficulty to make $100/month**: ★★★★☆ (4/5)
- **Difficulty to maintain**: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)

Creating a paid membership through platforms like Patreon is easy, but to make $100 per month, you need to provide $100 worth of value, which is quite difficult.

This method is more effective if you already have an audience. For example, Ali's YouTuber friend Hannah Witton has about 626 patrons out of 600,000 subscribers, earning her about $3,000-$7,000 per month. This means only about 0.1% of her subscribers have joined her Patreon.

Ali's 'Part-Time YouTuber Inner Circle' membership community generates about $2,800 per week, but it's not entirely passive.

### 8. Creating an Automated or Delegated Goods/Services Business

- **Difficulty to start**: ★★★★☆ (4/5)
- **Difficulty to make $100/month**: ★★★★☆ (4/5)
- **Difficulty to maintain**: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)

This method, often discussed in Tim Ferriss's '4-Hour Work Week,' involves creating a business that sells products or services and then automating or delegating parts of its operation.

For example, Ali's friend Oliur runs a million-dollar Shopify store designing, manufacturing, and selling vegan leather desk accessories. It took a lot of work initially, but now he has a team of three people managing the business, allowing him to spend relatively less time on it.

Another example is a friend who runs an Instagram and Facebook ads marketing agency, receiving a few hundred dollars monthly from clients. He's automated parts of his business using tools like Zapier.

### 9. Building an App, Website, or Software Product

- **Difficulty to start**: ★★★★★ (5/5)
- **Difficulty to make $100/month**: ★★★★☆ (4/5)
- **Difficulty to maintain**: ★★★☆☆ (3/5)

This method, also known as SaaS (Software as a Service), involves building an app or website and offering it as a one-time purchase or, more commonly, a subscription service. IndieHackers.com showcases hundreds of examples of software businesses generating passive income.

Ali created websites called 'BMAT Ninja' and 'UKCAT Ninja' during his university years, providing a question bank for medical school applicants. This business generated about $10,000 in the first year and about $25,000 in the fifth year.

Building an app is very difficult and requires programming knowledge, but once created, maintenance is relatively easier.

## Summary

Ali Abdaal's nine passive income methods each have different difficulty levels for starting, earning, and maintaining. The key insights from these methods include:

1. **There is no truly 'passive' income.** All income sources require some initial work and maintenance. What matters is providing value in a way that's not directly tied to your time.

2. **Generating passive income takes time.** Ali's $27,000 weekly passive income is the result of consistent effort over eight years. There are no 'get-rich-quick' methods.

3. **Investing is the easiest way to start but requires capital.** Stock investing is easy to start and maintain, but you need significant initial capital to earn meaningful returns.

4. **Content-based passive income (YouTube, podcasts, online courses) is most effective.** For Ali, Skillshare courses generate $15,000 per week, and YouTube generates $3,000 per week.

5. **Building an audience is key.** Most passive income methods are much more effective when you have an audience. Ali advises, "Create valuable content, post it free on the internet once a week, and do this for at least two years to build an audience."

6. **All methods require providing value.** Money is just a medium for exchanging value, and to earn passive income, you need to provide value that people are willing to pay for.

7. **Starting is hard, but maintenance is relatively easier.** All passive income methods require effort initially, but once the system is built, maintenance becomes relatively easier.

8. **Digital products and online courses are attractive options.** Digital products and online courses that you create once and can continue to sell are efficient sources of passive income.

9. **Software businesses have a high barrier to entry but potentially high rewards.** Developing an app or SaaS product is difficult, but if successful, it can generate substantial passive income.

The journey to earning passive income is about focusing on providing value from a long-term perspective, consistently putting in effort, and building systems that can benefit from compound effects over time rather than expecting quick results.
