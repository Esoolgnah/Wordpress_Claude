# Gary Vaynerchuk on Building Brand in the AI Era: Why Entrepreneurs Must Adapt or Become Commodities

## Overview

In a provocative and candid interview, serial entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk (known as "Gary Vee") shares his insights on the coming AI revolution and its profound implications for business owners. As artificial intelligence increasingly mediates consumer choices, Vaynerchuk warns that entrepreneurs face a clear ultimatum: build a recognizable brand or risk becoming commoditized. This article explores his perspectives on AI's impact on businesses, the importance of authentic content marketing, and his approach to building businesses that thrive in an increasingly competitive landscape. Drawing from his experience leading multiple successful ventures, including VaynerMedia and VeeFriends, Vaynerchuk offers tactical advice for entrepreneurs who want to remain relevant in an age where AI gatekeepers might soon control consumer access.

## The AI Revolution: How Chatbots Will Change Business

Vaynerchuk begins with a stark warning about the coming AI revolution: unlike search engines that primarily serve as intermediaries connecting consumers to businesses, AI chatbots could operate with different economic incentives. He believes this shift represents a fundamental change in how businesses acquire customers.

"What I'm more scared about is the companies that are building the best tech, I'm not sure they're going to be as gracious as Google and want to give away the business," Vaynerchuk explains. He contrasts Google's approach of recommending businesses through search results with the potential for AI platforms to capture more of the value chain themselves.

Using a real estate example, he illustrates: "When someone types in, 'I'm looking to buy a new home in Bristol,' I'm not so sold that ChatGPT is going to send you to a real estate agent. I think they're going to send you to their real estate agent."

This concern stems from the fundamental business model differences between search engines and AI companies. While Google built its empire on advertising revenues, letting businesses compete for visibility through ads and SEO, companies like OpenAI launched with subscription models from the start. This different monetization approach could lead to more vertically integrated strategies where the AI companies themselves capture more customer transactions.

## Building Brand: The Ultimate Defense Strategy

In response to this looming challenge, Vaynerchuk emphasizes that building a recognizable brand is no longer optional but essential for survival. A strong brand creates direct consumer demand that can't be easily intercepted or replaced by an algorithm.

"I'm more worried that we have to build brand because I don't want to be at the mercy of people," he says. The goal is to create such strong brand recognition that consumers specifically request your business by name: "I want them to be like, 'Hey ChatGPT, what would Gary Vee think about this?'"

This concept extends to both personal and business brands. Vaynerchuk emphasizes that while he's built a personal brand, entrepreneurs don't necessarily need to become the face of their companies. "You still don't even have to become the face or famous, but you need your business to do a much better job in being a brand," he clarifies. "Nobody knows who Johnny Coca-Cola is. Coca-Cola markets."

The key, according to Vaynerchuk, is consistent, high-volume content marketing that establishes brand presence and builds relationships with consumers directly, creating demand that AI intermediaries cannot easily redirect.

## Content Marketing: Quantity Over Perfection

When discussing implementation strategies, Vaynerchuk advocates strongly for high-volume content production. "Your business needs to put out 20 to 30 pieces of content a day throughout social," he recommends, emphasizing that this doesn't mean business owners must personally create all this content. They can delegate or hire specialists for this purpose.

He distinguishes his approach from the "lifestyle marketing" that has become prevalent on social media. "I don't even have a piece of jewelry on. I think this shirt's like nine bucks," he says, contrasting his authentic style with influencers who focus on displaying wealth. "Some people sell the lifestyle, other people live it."

For entrepreneurs uncomfortable with being the face of their brand, Vaynerchuk suggests focusing on making the business itself famous rather than the owner. "You can make your business famous... Coca-Cola markets. You don't know the IBM CEO or founder."

His perspective on content creation emphasizes authenticity over production value. A key insight from Vaynerchuk is that successful marketing doesn't require flashy displays of wealth or perfectionism—it requires consistency, volume, and authenticity.

## Charging What You're Worth: Market Reality Check

In a particularly revealing anecdote, Vaynerchuk shares his journey of determining his speaking fees. Starting from $5,000 per engagement, he gradually increased his rate until he encountered market resistance. This approach reflects his pragmatic philosophy about pricing: always aim higher, but recognize when the market pushes back.

"The way I got to my price was I kept going and then the market told me, 'You're not that guy yet, Gary,'" he explains. This iterative process of testing the market's willingness to pay represents a fundamental business lesson.

He challenges the common mindset that entrepreneurs inherently know their worth, stating bluntly: "Where people get this screwed up, brother, is they're like, 'I know my worth. I'm worth more.' I'm like, no, you're not. Nobody's paying you."

This reality check is balanced with encouragement to consistently push pricing boundaries: "You need to ask for more as often as possible. And don't stop." He advises entrepreneurs to persist through multiple rejections before concluding they've found their true market price.

## Leadership Vulnerabilities: The Candor Challenge

In a moment of striking vulnerability, Vaynerchuk shares his own leadership challenge: maintaining candor with employees. Despite his public persona of directness, he admits struggling with giving honest feedback to team members he develops personal connections with.

"My kryptonite in business has been candor," he confesses. "Gary Vee on stage is very good at candor. Gary Vaynerchuk, the human being, is so into the stuff I told you about employees. I get into family vibes with my employees."

This personal struggle led to a dysfunctional pattern: "The more I liked you, the harder it was for me to tell you the truth about what I thought you were as an employee, which led to me working around it." The consequences were significant—harboring resentment, avoiding necessary terminations, and ultimately creating shock when he finally took action: "The worst part of all, you're then mad at me because I never told you."

Vaynerchuk acknowledges that this communication failure persisted for 20 years and represents an area where having a coach might have helped him improve more quickly. This admission reveals that even successful entrepreneurs have blind spots that can limit their effectiveness.

## VeeFriends: Building an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem

Toward the end of the interview, Vaynerchuk shares his excitement about VeeFriends, describing it as "my Pokemon... my Disney... my Marvel." This project represents his vision for cultivating entrepreneurship, particularly among young people who might not be suited for traditional educational paths.

VeeFriends consists of 250 characters with names like "Patient Panda," "Accountable Ant," and "Competitive Clown," designed to help teach important life skills and entrepreneurial values. Vaynerchuk explains that a significant focus is "targeting the kids that should not go to university and should be entrepreneurs."

He criticizes the pervasive belief that university education is universally beneficial: "We got into this place in the last 40 years that everyone should go to university and college which is insanity." This perspective aligns with his broader philosophy of recognizing individual strengths and creating alternative pathways to success.

Through VeeFriends and related initiatives, Vaynerchuk is attempting to build an ecosystem that nurtures entrepreneurial talent outside traditional educational frameworks, reflecting his belief in diverse approaches to learning and career development.

## Summary

Gary Vaynerchuk's insights provide a compelling roadmap for entrepreneurs navigating an increasingly AI-dominated business landscape. His key messages include:

1. **AI will fundamentally change customer acquisition**: As AI platforms potentially take more control of the customer journey, businesses must adapt their strategies to avoid disintermediation.

2. **Brand building is essential for survival**: Creating strong brand recognition ensures customers specifically seek out your business, even through AI gatekeepers.

3. **Content marketing should prioritize volume and authenticity**: Producing consistent, authentic content is more important than perfectionism or displays of wealth.

4. **Market testing reveals true value**: Entrepreneurs should continually test price boundaries while respecting market feedback.

5. **Leadership requires self-awareness**: Even successful entrepreneurs have blind spots that can limit their effectiveness.

6. **Educational diversity matters**: Traditional educational paths aren't suited for everyone, particularly creative and entrepreneurial individuals.

Vaynerchuk's perspective offers both warning and encouragement—a clear-eyed assessment of coming challenges coupled with practical strategies for adaptation. His emphasis on brand building, authentic marketing, and pricing strategy provides actionable insights for entrepreneurs seeking to thrive in an increasingly AI-mediated economy.
