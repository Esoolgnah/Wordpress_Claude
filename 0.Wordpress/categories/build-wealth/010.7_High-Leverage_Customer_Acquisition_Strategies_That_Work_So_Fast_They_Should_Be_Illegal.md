# 7 High-Leverage Customer Acquisition Strategies That Work So Fast They Should Be Illegal

## Overview

In today's competitive business landscape, acquiring customers quickly and efficiently can mean the difference between thriving and merely surviving. Alex Hormozi, renowned entrepreneur and investor, reveals seven high-leverage customer acquisition strategies that generate results with remarkable speed. These strategies aren't about incremental improvements but rather focus on asymmetric returns—tactics that can potentially deliver 10x, 100x, or even 1000x results compared to the effort invested. This article breaks down Hormozi's most powerful customer acquisition frameworks that have helped build multiple successful businesses and can transform how you approach getting new customers for your business.

## 1. Give Away What Others Charge For

The first strategy Hormozi recommends is exceptionally powerful yet counterintuitive for many business owners: give away valuable products or services that your competitors charge for. The implementation has four simple steps:

1. Identify what competitors are charging for
2. Calculate your hard costs to deliver it
3. Offer it completely free
4. Measure lead generation and conversion rates

This approach works because it creates an irresistible value proposition that makes potential customers stop in their tracks. For example, if others in your industry charge $500 for a service, and you can deliver a comparable or superior version for a $90 cost, giving it away free can generate qualified leads at a fraction of normal acquisition costs.

The key is making your free offering significantly better than what competitors charge for. This creates an immediate perception of value and establishes trust with potential customers who experience your quality firsthand without risk. As Hormozi notes, when acquisition.com (his portfolio of companies) implements this strategy, they sometimes generate new leads every 6-12 seconds.

## 2. Leverage High-Skill Marketing Talent

Many businesses make a critical mistake with their marketing departments: they either understaff (with just the founder handling marketing) or overstaff (with too many underqualified people). Hormozi recommends a "fewer but better" approach when building marketing teams.

The difference between an average marketer and an exceptional one isn't 2-3x productivity—it can be 100x or more. This follows the same principle seen in software development, where a single exceptional developer might produce work equivalent to dozens of average programmers.

Hormozi shares a personal example: at his GymLaunch business, he reduced the marketing team from 17 people to just 5, and output tripled. This counterintuitive result happened because the highest-skilled people were given more responsibility and authority, while less productive team members were removed.

For small business owners, this means you might be better off paying one exceptional marketer significantly more rather than hiring several average ones. High-skill marketing talent is one of the highest-leverage investments a business can make.

## 3. Ask "What Would It Take To Be #1?"

Instead of thinking incrementally about improving your business by 10-20%, ask the transformative question: "What would it take for us to become number one in our market?"

This question forces you to think from a completely different perspective. Rather than making small improvements to current operations, you assume the outcome (being #1) and work backward to identify what would need to happen.

Hormozi illustrates this with his own journey. When he asked what it would take to become the top investor in his space, he realized he needed proprietary deal flow. This led him to focus on building a strong business brand through content creation and book publishing, which ultimately created the inbound opportunities he needed.

The magic of this question is that it often reveals solutions that are actually within reach but weren't being considered because they required a different allocation of resources or a shift in strategy. As Hormozi puts it, "Most of the time when I ask this question, teams usually state one or two key big things that would have to happen... and more times than not, we actually have the resources to make that happen."

## 4. Invest More in Pre-Production Than Post-Production

In marketing and content creation, many businesses focus too heavily on post-production—editing, effects, and polishing content after it's created. However, Hormozi argues that "an ounce of pre is worth a pound of post."

Pre-production—the thinking, planning, and preparation before content creation—offers substantially higher leverage:

- Developing better concepts and hooks that naturally attract more viewers
- Creating clearer structures that require less editing
- Preparing visual aids and examples that enhance comprehension
- Planning sequences that flow naturally without needing to be reordered

The result is not just better-performing marketing assets but also faster production cycles that allow you to create more content in less time. For educational or business content especially, focusing on pre-production clarity delivers better results than adding fancy effects afterward.

## 5. Minimize "Need-to-Believes"

One of the most powerful frameworks Hormozi shares is the concept of "need-to-believes"—the things a customer must believe to make a purchase decision. The fewer beliefs required, the faster and easier the sale.

Hormozi contrasts two businesses he operated:

- Prestige Labs (supplements): Required gym owners to believe both that they should sell supplements AND that Prestige was the right brand—two separate hurdles to overcome.
- Real estate investing education: Most people already believe real estate can be profitable, so the only "need-to-believe" is that the specific program or mentor can help them succeed.

Amazon exemplifies the minimum need-to-believes approach. Sellers only need to believe one thing: "If I list my product, someone might buy it." By removing every other conceivable barrier (marketing, customer service, logistics), Amazon created a platform that attracted millions of sellers.

The actionable takeaway: Analyze your current offering and identify all the things customers must believe to buy. Then restructure your offer to eliminate as many of these beliefs as possible, focusing on customers who already accept most of the fundamental premises.

## 6. Split Test the Highest-Leverage Elements

Split testing—comparing two versions of a marketing element to see which performs better—can deliver significant improvements in conversion rates. While most businesses understand the concept, Hormozi ranks the most important elements to test, based on their impact:

1. **Offers**: What you're actually selling or providing
2. **Packaging**: Headlines and sub-headlines that frame the offer
3. **Images**: Visual elements associated with the offer
4. **Third-party integrations**: The software and tools used to deliver the experience

Interestingly, while the first three are common knowledge, Hormozi reveals that third-party integrations have delivered some of his biggest conversion improvements. This includes testing different form providers, checkout systems, and other software elements that customers interact with.

The advantage of effective split testing is that improvements are usually permanent—once you discover a better headline or offer structure, you can implement it across all campaigns for ongoing benefit.

## 7. Build a "100% Commission" Affiliate Model

Traditional affiliate programs that offer 20-50% commissions often struggle to motivate partners to actively promote products. Hormozi's solution is radical but effective: create a separate, simplified version of your core offering and let affiliates keep 100% of the revenue.

For example, if you're a massage therapist:
- Instead of offering affiliates 20% of a massage package
- Create a special "3-massage package" that affiliates can sell at any price above your minimum
- Let them keep 100% of what they charge

This approach is psychologically different from a commission split. When partners can keep all the money, their motivation changes dramatically. Meanwhile, you acquire customers who:
1. Have already paid (removing the sales barrier)
2. Are pre-qualified (they valued your service enough to pay)
3. Cost only your hard costs to acquire (in the massage example, just the $30/hour labor cost)

These customers then enter your ecosystem where you can offer your full-price services for ongoing revenue. Using the massage example, if each package costs you $90 in labor costs and one in three customers converts to a $2,000 premium package, your effective acquisition cost is $270 for a $2,000 customer—an exceptional return.

## Bonus Strategy: Make Truth Your Greatest Ally

While not numbered in Hormozi's presentation, he emphasizes that truthfulness is a powerful customer acquisition strategy. Rather than hiding weaknesses, successful marketers acknowledge them and then pivot to their strengths.

He recommends using what he calls the "bad, bad, bad, but good" formula. By admitting several weaknesses but following them with a compelling strength, you:

1. Build credibility (people believe someone who admits flaws)
2. Neutralize objections before they arise
3. Make your positive claims more believable
4. Create the perception of authenticity

For example, a gym owner might say: "I don't have the biggest gym, the most equipment, or the fanciest facilities, but we get better results for our members than anyone else in town."

This technique is particularly effective because it leverages a psychological principle—people trust those who admit weaknesses, and they're more likely to believe positive claims that follow such admissions.

## Summary

These seven high-leverage customer acquisition strategies can dramatically accelerate your business growth:

1. **Give away what others charge for**: Create irresistible value by offering premium services for free to generate qualified leads.

2. **Leverage high-skill marketing talent**: Invest in fewer but significantly better marketers who can deliver exponentially better results.

3. **Ask "What would it take to be #1?"**: Think transformatively by working backward from the goal of market dominance.

4. **Prioritize pre-production**: Invest time in planning and preparation rather than fixing and enhancing after creation.

5. **Minimize "need-to-believes"**: Restructure your offer to require fewer belief changes from your prospects.

6. **Split test the highest-leverage elements**: Systematically improve your conversion rates by testing offers, packaging, images, and even third-party software.

7. **Build a "100% commission" affiliate model**: Create separate, simplified offerings that partners can sell while keeping all the revenue.

When implemented correctly, these strategies create powerful momentum in customer acquisition, potentially generating leads and sales at a pace that truly does "feel illegal"—though they're completely legitimate approaches based on understanding human psychology and business leverage points.
