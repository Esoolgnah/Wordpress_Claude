# From $10,500 to $100,000 in 90 Days: A Real Estate Wealth Strategy Anyone Can Use

## Overview

In this insightful video, Meet Kevin shares a transformative real estate investment strategy he used when he was just 19 years old that allowed him to turn $10,500 into $100,000+ in just 90 days. Unlike traditional investing approaches like putting money in the stock market, Kevin demonstrates how leverage through real estate can dramatically accelerate wealth creation, even for someone with minimal starting capital. His story challenges conventional wisdom and provides a blueprint for those looking to build substantial wealth through property investing, particularly using government-backed loan programs designed for first-time homebuyers.

## The Decision That Changed Everything

At 19, Kevin found himself frustrated with the traditional path to wealth. Working at Red Robin and Jamba Juice for $8-9 per hour, he calculated that at the rate his wages were increasing (from $8.00 to $8.10 after a year of hard work), it would take him roughly 500 years to build meaningful wealth.

With about $10,000 saved up, he considered his options:

1. **Investing in an S&P 500 index fund**: While this would have tripled his money over the next decade (turning $10K into $30K), it still wouldn't represent life-changing wealth.

2. **Using margin trading**: Potentially doubling his stock investments with margin to $20K, which at a 10% return would yield only $2,000.

But while studying for his real estate license (not to represent clients, but rather to learn how wealthy people use real estate), he discovered something that would change his financial trajectory forever: the FHA 203k loan program.

## Understanding Leverage: The Power of FHA Loans

The critical insight Kevin shares is about financial leverage. He breaks it down with simple yet powerful math:

> "With my $10,000 in stocks, a 10% return would give me about $1,000. But if I control a $300,000 house and it appreciates 10%, that's $30,000 in growth—from the same initial investment."

The FHA loan program allows buyers to:

- Purchase a home with just 3.5% down payment
- Control an asset worth far more than their initial investment
- Live in the property while building equity

Kevin explains that with approximately $10,500, he could control a $300,000 property—something impossible with traditional stock investing.

## Addressing the "Catch"

Kevin candidly discusses the concerns that many have about leveraging real estate:

1. **Taking on significant debt**: He reasoned that as long as he could make the payments, this wasn't a major issue.

2. **Risk of job loss**: Unlike stocks where margin calls can force selling at the worst time, with real estate he could simply rent out the property and have tenants cover the mortgage.

3. **Falling property values**: Unlike margin accounts where brokers call when values drop, mortgage lenders don't call loans due when property values decline—as long as payments are made.

The key insight: "I can control a lot of wealth with very little wealth in real estate."

## The $100,000 Deal Breakdown

With his knowledge of FHA loans, Kevin and his partner Lauren found a property for $305,000 that needed significant work—with no kitchen or bathrooms. The neighborhood typically had homes valued between $450,000-$500,000 when in good condition.

Here's how he structured the deal:

1. **Purchase**: $305,000 using an FHA 203k loan with 3.5% down payment (approximately $10,500)
2. **Renovation Financing**: The loan included approximately $50,000 for renovations
3. **Bridge Financing**: To speed up renovations (since FHA 203k loans disburse slowly), he temporarily borrowed $25,000 from a hard money lender at 9% interest
4. **Time Investment**: 90 days of renovation work to make the property livable

After completing renovations and moving in, he refinanced the property. The house appraised for $550,000, allowing him to:

1. **Get a new loan**: 80% loan-to-value on $550,000 = $440,000 loan without mortgage insurance
2. **Pay off the existing loan**: $340,000 (purchase + renovations)
3. **Pocket the difference**: $100,000 tax-free cash (which he used to purchase his first rental property)

The real wealth creation was even more impressive. Not only did he walk away with $100,000 in cash, but he also had $110,000 in equity remaining in the property ($550,000 value - $440,000 loan). This effectively turned his $10,500 investment into $210,000 in net worth.

## Risk Management: What If the Market Hadn't Appreciated?

Kevin addresses the concern that his success was simply due to lucky market timing. He breaks down alternative scenarios:

1. **If the property appraised for only $450,000**: An 80% loan would still give him $360,000, which after paying off the $340,000 loan would leave $20,000 in his pocket—still doubling his initial investment.

2. **If property values fell**: He still had the option to rent the property, with rental income covering the mortgage payments.

3. **If he needed to sell**: Since he bought substantially below market value, he had a significant margin of safety even if values declined somewhat.

The key was buying at a discount in a good neighborhood, adding value through renovations, and using leverage strategically.

## How You Can Replicate This Strategy

Kevin provides a clear roadmap for those looking to implement a similar approach:

1. **Commit to buying**: Make the decision that you're going to invest and act on it.

2. **Get pre-approved**: Contact a local loan officer and get pre-approved before looking at properties.

3. **Partner with an investor-friendly agent**: Find a real estate agent who understands investment properties.

4. **Check the market daily**: Be vigilant about searching platforms like Redfin and Zillow.

5. **Write offers quickly**: When you find a good deal, submit an offer immediately.

6. **Look for properties needing work**: The best opportunities are often properties that need renovation.

7. **Understand multiple-offer situations**: Competition for a property often indicates you've found a good deal.

Kevin notes that this strategy works best with properties that need some work, creating what he calls a "wedge deal" where you can buy at a discount and add significant value through improvements.

## Summary

The key insights from Meet Kevin's real estate wealth creation strategy include:

1. **Leverage is powerful**: Using FHA loans with small down payments allows you to control substantial assets with minimal capital.

2. **Value-add renovations accelerate growth**: Buying undervalued properties and improving them creates equity regardless of market conditions.

3. **Exit strategies provide safety**: Whether refinancing, renting, or eventually selling, having multiple options reduces risk.

4. **Tax advantages enhance returns**: When structured properly, cash from refinancing is not taxable, and living in the property for two years provides homeowner exemptions.

5. **Speed matters**: Taking decisive action when opportunities present themselves is crucial in competitive markets.

The power of this approach lies in its accessibility—it doesn't require special connections, vast wealth, or unique expertise. With a modest amount of capital, proper research, and willingness to put in the work, this real estate strategy offers a potential path to wealth creation that traditional investing simply cannot match in terms of speed and magnitude.
