# The CLIMB Method: How to Turn Your Regular Paycheck Into Lasting Wealth

## Overview

In this comprehensive wealth-building guide, Jaspreet Singh of Minority Mindset explains how to systematically transform your regular paycheck into sustainable wealth. For most Americans, a paycheck is simply a way to pay bills, leaving them trapped in a cycle of debt with little hope of financial freedom. However, Singh presents a powerful framework called the CLIMB method that can help anyone break this cycle through disciplined, bite-sized steps. The approach compares wealth building to climbing a mountain – a journey requiring preparation and deliberate, sequential steps rather than attempting to leap to the summit in a single bound. This method creates a clear roadmap for moving from financial insecurity to long-term prosperity.

## The CLIMB Framework Explained

Singh's CLIMB framework consists of six crucial steps (including the pre-climb preparation) that systematically build upon each other:

### C - Create Your Financial Base

The first step focuses on establishing a solid financial foundation through two key actions:

1. **Save $2,000 as fast as possible**: This initial emergency fund prevents you from falling back into credit card debt when unexpected expenses arise. It's not your complete emergency fund – just enough to handle minor emergencies while you focus on debt elimination.

2. **Pay off all high-interest debts**: Once you have your $2,000 safety net, aggressively pay down credit card debt and other high-interest obligations that keep you trapped in what Singh calls the "financial danger zone."

During this phase, Singh emphasizes making extreme sacrifices: no vacations, no restaurant meals, no non-essential purchases, and even cutting entertainment subscriptions like Netflix. The goal isn't just saving money but reclaiming the time spent consuming entertainment to instead learn about personal finance, investing, and side hustles.

> "If you have credit card debt, you should not feel comfortable watching whatever's on Netflix...right now you've got to have the fire on your butt because you've got a problem. You're in the financial danger zone and you've got to get serious about it."

This initial stage requires the most discipline, but it creates the foundation for everything that follows.

### L - Lead Your Money

The second step involves creating a systematic approach to managing your money. Singh points out that most people follow a broken financial pattern:

**Typical pattern**: Earn money → Pay taxes → Spend money → Save/invest whatever's left (usually nothing)

**Wealth-building pattern**: Earn money → Set aside savings/investments first → Spend what remains

Singh recommends his 75-15-10 rule as a starting point:

- 75% maximum for spending
- 15% minimum for investing
- 10% minimum for saving

This system ensures you're consistently building wealth with every paycheck before a single dollar is spent. To implement this, Singh suggests:

1. Create three separate bank accounts for spending, investing, and saving
2. Set up automatic transfers on payday to immediately distribute your income according to your percentages
3. Only spend from your spending account

He compares this to paying taxes – when the government raises taxes, you adjust your lifestyle to accommodate. Similarly, by "taxing yourself" with the 25% going to investing and saving, you're forced to find ways to live within the remaining 75%, even if it means downsizing your lifestyle temporarily.

### I - Interest-Free Living

The third step focuses on breaking free from financing consumer purchases. Singh advocates two main principles:

1. **Stop financing things that don't generate income**: With the exception of your primary residence, avoid borrowing money for consumer purchases – especially cars, electronics, and luxury items.

2. **The Rule of Five for luxuries**: If you can't afford to buy five of something, you can't truly afford even one. This principle helps prevent the common mistake of confusing having enough cash for a purchase with truly being able to afford it.

Singh is particularly adamant about not financing vehicles, describing car loans as a "triple whammy" that combines:

- Financing a depreciating asset
- Paying interest on something losing value
- Investing in something with a limited lifespan

> "I'm not against you buying a BMW or something nice. I just want you to be able to afford it first... Be able to afford it with cash."

By eliminating consumer debt and the associated interest payments, you free up significant cash flow that can be redirected toward wealth-building investments.

### M - Multiplier Income

The fourth step addresses the income side of the wealth equation. While the previous steps focus primarily on managing what you earn more effectively, this step focuses on increasing your earning capacity.

Singh explains that there's a limit to how much you can save from your current income – you might adjust your percentages to spend less and invest more, but the potential is constrained by your income. In contrast, there's theoretically no limit to how much you can earn.

The key insight is to develop a growth mindset around your income potential. If you're currently earning $50,000 annually, the goal isn't to find an extra $1,000 to invest – it's to find ways to grow your income to $500,000 or beyond, which would allow you to invest an additional $100,000+ annually.

Singh acknowledges this won't happen overnight and might involve:

- Starting a side business
- Acquiring new certifications or skills
- Changing careers
- Negotiating raises
- Creating additional income streams

The path might include failures and setbacks, but the objective is to gradually scale your earnings, perhaps starting with an extra $1,000 monthly, then growing to $5,000, $10,000, and beyond.

As your income grows and you maintain your percentage-based system, everything scales together – you'll have more to invest, more to save, and more to spend, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of wealth creation.

### B - Be Great

The final stage of the framework focuses on two dimensions of greatness:

1. **Be great for your family by protecting your assets**:

   - Hire appropriate advisors (attorneys, tax professionals, financial advisors)
   - Implement proper estate planning (wills, trusts)
   - Consider life insurance to protect your family
   - Create proper asset protection strategies

2. **Be great for your community by giving back**:
   - Share your wealth, time, knowledge, and expertise
   - Help others advance in their own journeys
   - Recognize that "the more you have, the more you can do"

This step acknowledges that true wealth isn't just about accumulation but about protection, perpetuation, and positive impact.

### Pre-Climb: Mindset Preparation

Singh intentionally discusses the foundational mindset work last, though it's technically the starting point. This preparation stage focuses on developing a wealth-oriented mindset before beginning the practical steps.

> "You have to be wealthy in your mindset before you can be wealthy in your bank account."

Many people have internalized limiting beliefs about money from their upbringing – that money is evil, limited, or that wealth is unattainable for them. These beliefs create self-sabotage that prevents financial success regardless of what practical steps they take.

Singh emphasizes that wealth building requires:

- Recognizing money as a neutral tool that amplifies who you are
- Understanding that it's not wrong to desire financial success
- Developing an abundance mindset rather than a scarcity perspective
- Breaking generational patterns of poverty thinking

This mindset shift creates the psychological foundation necessary to successfully implement the practical CLIMB steps.

## Summary

The CLIMB framework provides a comprehensive roadmap for transforming ordinary income into extraordinary wealth:

1. **Create your financial base** by building a small emergency fund and eliminating high-interest debt, making extreme sacrifices if necessary to escape the financial danger zone.

2. **Lead your money** by implementing a percentage-based system that ensures you're saving and investing before spending, using automatic transfers to separate accounts.

3. **Interest-free living** means stopping the financing of depreciating assets and consumer purchases, only buying luxuries when you can truly afford them.

4. **Multiplier income** focuses on expanding your earning capacity through side businesses, career advancement, or additional income streams rather than just squeezing more savings from your current income.

5. **Be great** by protecting your growing wealth through proper advisors and insurance while also giving back to your community.

6. **Pre-climb preparation** involves developing the wealth-oriented mindset necessary for long-term success, breaking limiting beliefs about money.

Singh emphasizes that this journey isn't about overnight success but rather "a decade of sacrifice" – spending less and earning more so you can invest aggressively and build lasting wealth. By taking consistent, deliberate steps and focusing on both the practical and psychological aspects of wealth building, anyone can climb their own wealth mountain and achieve financial freedom.
