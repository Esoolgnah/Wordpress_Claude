# Beyond the Buzzword: How This Creator Actually Generates $7,000 Monthly in Passive Income

## Overview

In this insightful video, personal finance YouTuber Ryan Scribner breaks down his various passive income streams that collectively generate over $7,000 monthly. Unlike many creators who oversell the "passive income dream," Ryan takes a refreshingly pragmatic approach, emphasizing that passive income isn't money falling from the sky but rather the delayed rewards of upfront work or investment. He shares his wish that someone had made this type of transparent breakdown when he was starting out, which motivated him to create this educational resource for others wondering if generating significant passive income is genuinely possible.

## Understanding True Passive Income

Ryan begins by addressing common misconceptions about passive income:

He intentionally avoids using the term "passive income" too liberally because he feels it has become a buzzword that many people use without fully understanding what it actually means. There's a widespread misconception that passive income is essentially "money falling from the sky" or "growing on trees," when the reality is much more pragmatic.

The key insight Ryan emphasizes is that passive income isn't free money - it requires either significant time investment upfront or financial investment that will then yield rewards later. As he puts it, "You're doing something upfront to then reap the rewards of that work or that investment later on down the road."

This is why some prominent business figures like Gary Vaynerchuk don't speak favorably about passive income - they recognize that many people misunderstand what's actually involved in creating these income streams.

## Ryan's Passive Income Breakdown

### 1. YouTube Ad Revenue: $5,000-$6,000/month

Ryan's largest source of passive income comes from YouTube ad revenue, generating between $5,000-$6,000 monthly. What makes this particularly interesting is the passive nature of these earnings - approximately 80% comes from videos created in 2018, 15% from 2017 videos, and only about 5% from videos made in the current month.

However, he cautions that YouTube isn't 100% passive:

"Because I didn't really put much work into it in January [when he was traveling], I was traveling I made like two or three videos maybe four, I'm probably gonna see the negative effects of that in February and in March and in April."

Unlike some passive investments that can continue paying for decades with minimal maintenance, YouTube content has a natural decay in viewership and revenue that requires ongoing attention to maintain earnings.

### 2. Amazon Associates: ~$500/month

Ryan earns almost $500 monthly through Amazon's affiliate program, and interestingly, about 75% of this revenue comes from old YouTube videos created in 2016-2017 on several other channels he owns. These videos, primarily product reviews for items like laptops and tech products, continue generating clicks and commissions years later.

He explains that product review videos can be particularly lucrative: "If you get like 10,000 views on a product review video and you're really persuasive about a certain product, you can make thousands of dollars." This is because viewers actively seeking product reviews often have high purchase intent, leading to better conversion rates.

This passive income source alone covers the majority of his rent each month.

### 3. Dividend Stocks: ~$100/month

Ryan has been building a dividend portfolio since he was just 11 years old (starting around 2009), which now generates approximately $100 monthly in dividend payments. He notes that this amount is averaged across the year since some months might yield only $20 while others bring in $200, depending on payment schedules.

He views dividend investing as an accessible strategy for anyone: "If you buy Pepsi stock, you might get a couple percent interest on that stock over the course of a year, and you also get probably over the long run you're getting to see growth in that stock as well."

His long-term goal aligns with wealth-building principles: "Eventually the goal is that eventually you have enough in investments where you can live off of that and that's why the rich stay rich."

### 4. High-Yield Savings: ~$38/month

Ryan recommends high-yield savings accounts as perhaps the most accessible passive income source for everyone. At the time of recording, he was earning 2.25% interest through Marcus by Goldman Sachs.

He provides practical examples of the earnings potential: with $20,000 saved, one could earn approximately $38 monthly ($457 annually) in interest. Even with $5,000 saved, that's still over $100 annually in completely passive income.

Ryan suggests this strategy is particularly good for emergency funds or for those who feel wary about the stock market: "It's like a few free pizzas at Pizza Hut or you could pay your phone bill with that or your Wi-Fi bill for just having some money in a bank account."

### 5. Affiliate Marketing for Financial Products: ~$700/month

The final income stream Ryan discusses comes from promoting financial products and services through affiliate links, generating nearly $700 monthly. He takes a principled approach to these promotions, sharing that of the 15-20 popular investing apps available, he only promotes four that he personally uses and believes in: M1 Finance, Robinhood, Stash Invest, and Acorns.

He notes that some companies offer higher commissions ($20-30 per signup), but he chooses not to promote them because he doesn't personally like or use their products: "I think if you follow the money too much you can cause some harm to yourself and obviously to people who watch your videos."

This ethical approach to affiliate marketing differentiates him from creators who might promote any product offering high commissions.

## Key Takeaways for Building Passive Income

Throughout the video, Ryan emphasizes several important principles for those seeking to build passive income streams:

1. **Upfront investment is required** - Whether it's time (creating content) or money (investing), passive income requires significant input before yielding returns

2. **Long-term perspective is essential** - Many of his income streams took years to develop to their current level

3. **Multiple streams create stability** - His $7,000 monthly comes from five different sources, not relying solely on any single method

4. **Authenticity matters** - He only promotes products he genuinely uses and believes in, even when it means turning down higher commissions

5. **Work smarter, not harder** - As he concludes: "The biggest tip I would say is work smarter and not harder. I think if you put your head down and grind for too much without actually thinking about the big picture sometimes it can hurt in the long run."

## Summary

Ryan Scribner's breakdown of his $7,000 monthly passive income demonstrates that building meaningful passive income is genuinely possible but requires a realistic understanding of what "passive" truly means. His largest streams come from content creation (YouTube ad revenue and Amazon Associates), followed by financial product affiliates, with smaller but growing contributions from traditional investments (dividend stocks and high-yield savings).

The key insight throughout his breakdown is that passive income requires either significant time or money investment upfront before yielding returns later. By creating valuable content, making consistent investments, and taking a principled approach to promotions, Ryan has built multiple income streams that collectively provide substantial monthly revenue with reduced ongoing time requirements.

For those looking to develop their own passive income sources, Ryan's journey offers both inspiration and a necessary reality check about the work involved in building these streams. Most importantly, his experience confirms that with the right approach and realistic expectations, generating significant passive income is indeed achievable.
