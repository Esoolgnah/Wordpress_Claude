# What Really Creates Financial Success? The Truth Behind the Money Guy Survey Results

## Overview

A recent Empower survey asked Americans what they believe are the largest contributors to financial success, and the results were surprising. While 84% of respondents chose "hard work" as the biggest factor, the Money Guy team (Brian Preston and Bo Hansen) explains why this perspective might be missing a critical component. This article breaks down what truly creates wealth according to financial experts with decades of experience managing money, and why understanding the power of investing matters more than most people realize.

## The Survey Results: What Americans Think Creates Wealth

According to the Empower survey, here's how Americans ranked the factors that contribute to financial success (respondents were asked to select their top three choices, which is why percentages add up to more than 100%):

1. Hard work (84%)
2. Talent (65%)
3. Who you know (55%)
4. Luck and circumstances (51%)
5. Being a visionary (36%)
6. Putting money away for retirement (35%)
7. Outworking everyone (32%)

The Money Guy team found it shocking that "putting money away for retirement" was near the bottom of the list, suggesting a fundamental misunderstanding about wealth creation.

## The Three True Ingredients to Wealth Creation

Brian and Bo explain that while hard work is important, it's only the starting point. The real formula for financial success consists of three key components:

1. **Discipline**: Living on less than you make
2. **Money**: Creating margin through discipline
3. **Time**: Giving your money time to work through investing

The critical insight they share is that hard work alone has natural limits. As Brian explains, "If you're not trying to figure out how to turn that hard work (your time and labor) into resources that will let you buy your time and labor back, that's where you're missing it." 

In other words, the goal should be to convert your labor into investments that will eventually work for you.

## Hard Work Has Limitations You Need to Understand

The team highlights several limitations of relying solely on hard work:

1. **Physical constraints**: Jobs that require physical labor become harder as you age
2. **Time constraints**: High-demand careers often require 60-70 hour weeks that become unsustainable
3. **Income ceiling**: Most jobs have an upper limit on how much you can earn

Bo adds that "the earlier you figure this out, the less hard the work has to be." Someone who starts investing early in their career—even in a modest job—can build significant wealth simply through consistent saving and investing over time.

## The Concerning Statistic: 47% Don't Believe They'll Reach Financial Success

Nearly half of Americans believe they will never reach their desired level of financial success. The Money Guy team attributes this largely to misinformation and a "fake it till you make it" mentality, especially prevalent among younger generations (19% of Gen Z cited this as a strategy).

Brian warns that this mindset, often perpetuated by marketing, leads people to focus on consumption rather than building wealth: "That sounds like an infomercial for consumption and consumerism... 'Hey, it's okay, you can have your best life right now, $200 a month, spread it out amortize your life, you'll be okay.'"

## Start Now, Regardless of Where You Are

A key message is that it's never too late to shift your strategy. Whether you're just starting your career at 22 or already established at 52, understanding how to turn your labor into investments can dramatically change your financial trajectory.

The team recommends using their "Wealth Multiplier Tool" (available at moneyguy.com/resources) to visualize how investing can transform your financial future.

## Q&A: Practical Financial Guidance

The show also covered several key financial questions:

### On Traditional vs. Roth 401(k) Contributions

For someone in the "gray zone" (25-30% combined federal and state marginal tax rate), the decision between traditional and Roth contributions should consider:

1. Your age (younger investors might favor Roth)
2. Future income projections
3. Your account structure and goals
4. Assumptions about future tax rates

### On Private vs. Public School Education

When deciding between private and public education, the team emphasized:

1. Education is a major life decision, not just a financial one
2. Be clear on your "why" rather than making it a status symbol
3. Consider opportunity costs of private education (like college savings)
4. Begin with the end in mind, especially for college admissions

### On Life Insurance with Medical Conditions

For those with medical histories that make life insurance expensive:

1. Maximize employer-sponsored group coverage (which often doesn't require individual underwriting)
2. Consider shorter-term policies focused on specific timeline needs
3. Evaluate your net worth structure to determine how close you are to self-insuring

### On Financial Order of Operations During Adoption

When balancing adoption expenses with investing:
1. It's okay to temporarily pause certain investments to build your emergency fund
2. Never forego employer matching (step 2 in the Financial Order of Operations)
3. Consider it a temporary "mission critical" pause before resuming your financial plan

### On Retirement Plan Access Through Rule of 55

The Rule of 55 allows penalty-free access to 401(k) funds if:
1. You were employed by the company in the year you turn 55
2. You leave the funds in the 401(k) (not rolled into an IRA)
3. You separate from that employer at or after age 55

### On Maximizing Multiple Retirement Plans

For someone with access to a 401(a), 403(b), and 457 plan:
1. Always capture the employer match first
2. 457 plans offer a separate contribution limit ($23,500) beyond the combined 401/403 limit
3. Consider investment options, internal expenses, and withdrawal rules when allocating

### On Evaluating the ROI of Further Education

When considering going back to school:
1. Create three plans: a dream plan, down-to-earth plan, and worst-case scenario
2. Build cash reserves to bridge the transition period
3. Question the probability of the promised income increase
4. Consider happiness and fulfillment, not just financial return

## Summary

While hard work is an essential component of financial success, it's only the beginning of the wealth-building journey. The true path to financial freedom comes from:

1. Working hard to create income
2. Disciplining yourself to live on less than you make
3. Investing the difference consistently
4. Giving your investments time to grow
5. Understanding that eventually your money should work harder than you do

As Brian concludes, "Your money should work harder than you do." This perspective shift from working hard to making your money work hard is the key insight most Americans are missing in their quest for financial success.
