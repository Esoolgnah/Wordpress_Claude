# From Zero to $48 Million: How Hush Blankets Built an Empire by Simply Listening to Customers

## Overview

In just four years, Aaron Spivak and Leor Grebler turned a $4,000 investment into a $48 million business by creating Hush Blankets, a weighted blanket company that revolutionized the sleep industry. What started as a side hustle soon became one of Canada's biggest success stories. But their path to success wasn't linear—they faced bankruptcy, survived a season with zero sales, and had to create entirely new technologies just to stay afloat. This article reveals the incredible story of how two entrepreneurs built and sold a multi-million dollar business in just 48 months by developing a simple but powerful formula: talking directly to customers, understanding their problems, and creating solutions they actually wanted.

## The Genesis of Hush Blankets

Aaron Spivak was no stranger to entrepreneurship. Growing up, he had tried his hand at everything from lemonade stands to party buses and even owned a juice shop in Toronto. But when he met Leor Grebler, everything changed. Leor, who was running a software company at the time, introduced Aaron to the growing trend of weighted blankets, which were gaining significant search volume online.

The two decided to create a superior weighted blanket while maintaining their day jobs. Aaron would work at his juice shop from 6 AM until 2 or 3 PM, while Leor ran his software company. Every evening at 7 PM, they would meet at Leor's apartment and work until 1 or 2 AM developing their product.

With just one sample blanket and basic product images, they created a pre-order website and started running Google ads for the keyword "weighted blankets." The strategy worked immediately:

> "First sale came in, we made I think like 20 bucks. The next day we made three sales. I remember Leor and I took those three sales, extrapolated over the year, I'm like, 'Oh my God, we're gonna buy Ferraris! We're rich!'"

Their growth was extraordinary. Within months, they were processing 30, then 60, then 90 thousand dollars in monthly sales.

## The Summer Crisis

Just when they thought they had struck gold, disaster hit. In July, Toronto experienced its hottest month of the year, with temperatures reaching 30°C (86°F). Sales dropped precipitously:

> "We went from all those sales to literally zero sales most days, and some days one. Our best day of the month we maybe had two sales."

They had made a critical mistake: not forecasting seasonal demand. They were now sitting on hundreds of unsellable weighted blankets and quickly running out of cash. The situation became so dire that Leor called Aaron to suggest shutting down the business:

> "My co-founder Leor called me and he's like, 'Hey, we gotta shut this business down because I'm not interested in a seasonal business. We have a seasonal product, we're stuck with all this inventory, let's get rid of it as fast as possible.'"

This moment forced Aaron to confront some difficult questions:

> "Am I actually the real deal? Do I actually know what the hell I'm doing? Do people actually like my product? Was this all an accident?"

## The Breakthrough Moment

Instead of giving up, Aaron had a brilliant idea. If they couldn't sell blankets in the summer, they needed to understand why. So in August 2018, they did something unconventional: they sent an email to all of their customers with a Calendly link, offering to speak with them directly.

The feedback was unanimous:

> "Every single person said the exact same thing: 'Aaron, we love the blanket, it's so amazing, it's incredible, but I'm sweating in places I've never sweat before. It's disgusting. So I'm putting it in my closet, and in the winter, I'll pull it back out.'"

This feedback led to their biggest breakthrough: creating a cooling weighted blanket that people could use year-round. They spent September flying around the world, talking to suppliers, and ultimately developed their own proprietary "ice fabric"—the coolest fabric in the world, which keeps users cool without water or fans.

But creating this fabric wasn't cheap. It would cost $100,000 for the first roll, and they were down to their last $4,000.

## The Kickstarter Success

With investors off the table (they wanted to remain bootstrapped and keep 100% of the business), Aaron and Leor launched a Kickstarter campaign with a modest goal of $25,000.

The result? They raised over one million dollars in the first 30 days.

When people asked about their secret to Kickstarter success, Aaron had a simple answer:

> "I had 3,000 people that literally told me on the phone that they would buy it if I made it."

## Breaking the Internet on Dragon's Den

To build on their momentum, Aaron and Leor decided to appear on Dragon's Den (Canada's version of Shark Tank). Their appearance made history:

> "In 14 seasons—so 14 years of the show—there's never been a pitch that came on and increased their valuation on live TV through debate amongst the dragons. And we were the first. We broke the internet. We went viral on Netflix for doing that for the first time ever."

This appearance catapulted the brand to new heights. By 2020, they had doubled down on their success, reinvesting every dollar earned.

## The Formula: Talk, Understand, Create

The duo had discovered a winning formula: talk to customers, understand their problems, and create products to solve them. They applied this formula to launch a pillow, selling 3,000 units in just 72 hours.

> "Everyone's initial reaction is like, 'What was the marketing? What was the email? What was the hype?' And it's like, 'Well, no, actually. The entire last year, we were talking to our customers, literally asking them what pillow they want.'"

They repeated this process with the Hush Ice Blanket 2.0 and Hush Ice Bed Sheets, reaching $20 million in sales that year and setting a goal of $40 million for the following year.

## The Final Product and Acquisition

With plans to sell the business, Aaron and Leor needed one more product to increase their valuation. They decided to enter the challenging mattress-in-a-box industry:

> "We had the stupidest idea in the world, which was to launch a mattress in a box. No one makes money selling mattresses in a box, but for whatever reason, we thought we could."

Again, they spent three months calling customers to understand what would make the perfect mattress. To their surprise, they discovered that the biggest pain point was that customers' current mattresses were uncomfortable during intimate moments.

> "We went out, we created a specific zone technology that has specific springs and specific areas that keep you flat no matter how you're positioned or how you're leaning up against something."

The mattress generated $1.5 million on launch day. Shortly after, in October 2021, the largest sleep company in Canada acquired Hush Blankets.

## The Power of Community and Storytelling

Looking back on their journey, Aaron realized that all those phone calls and customer conversations had created something invaluable: a community of superfans who would buy from them forever. This became evident when they opened their first pop-up store:

> "Allō also decided to come to Canada, opened the same time as us, and they had 700 people come through their door on opening day. We had 1,500. And who came? Our people. There's a blanket behind you—someone had us sign their blanket and they gave it back to us as a souvenir."

An executive from the acquiring company was amazed:

> "I've never in my 25 years in this industry would think that someone would ask a guy that sells blankets to sign the blanket."

This community was built through storytelling. Aaron and Leor documented their journey and got customers involved from the start:

> "I think storytelling is the most important thing you can have when you're marketing a brand. Storytelling is the emotions and it's the magic that people want to feel before they go out and purchase something."

## The Internet: Leveling the Playing Field

Aaron attributes much of their success to the internet's ability to level the playing field for entrepreneurs:

> "What the internet afforded us was guys like me are able to go and compete with the big guys. Previously, you needed to go and knock on doors of these retailers and beg for them to take your product. They'd put you in a shitty corner, no one would try it, you'd have no sales, you'd have returns... the barrier to entry was so big. But now there's a story for the underdog."

## Summary

Hush Blankets' journey from $4,000 to $48 million in just four years illustrates several key business lessons:

1. **Listen to your customers**: Aaron and Leor's breakthrough came when they personally called customers to understand their problems.

2. **Adapt to challenges**: When faced with a seasonal slump, they didn't give up but instead created an innovative cooling weighted blanket.

3. **Build a community, not just a product line**: Through storytelling and transparency, they created a loyal customer base that felt personally invested in their success.

4. **Stay bootstrapped when possible**: By avoiding outside investment, they maintained control and kept 100% of the profits.

5. **Validate before you build**: Their successful Kickstarter campaign worked because they had already validated demand by talking to thousands of potential customers.

6. **Leverage the internet**: The digital landscape allowed them to compete with established companies without the traditional barriers to entry.

Aaron and Leor's story proves that with determination, customer focus, and strategic thinking, entrepreneurs can build multi-million dollar businesses in record time—even with limited starting capital. The internet has created a world where the underdogs can not only compete but win big by simply listening to what customers actually want.
