# The Success Habits of the Top 0.1%: Unexpected Strategies from Silicon Valley's Secret Coach

## Overview

In this comprehensive video, Ali Abdaal shares the transformative wisdom of Joe Hudson, a secretive and highly sought-after executive coach who works with the CEOs of major companies like Apple, Google, and OpenAI. Hudson's approach to success dramatically differs from conventional productivity advice, focusing instead on deeper emotional patterns and internal states that drive our decisions. Rather than emphasizing discipline, willpower, and pushing through resistance, the top 0.1% of performers cultivate five specific habits that allow them to achieve extraordinary results with less friction and greater fulfillment. These strategies have transformed the lives of literal billionaires and could potentially revolutionize yours as well.

## Habit 1: The Iterative Mindset (Prioritize Pace Over Perfection)

Most people believe success requires meticulous planning and perfect preparation before taking action. However, top performers embrace an entirely different approach:

> "Every successful CEO I know cares more about the pace of the company than they do about getting anything perfect. They have a very iterative mindset... I don't care if we make mistakes. I don't care if we get it right, as long as we're actually moving forward."

This iterative mindset prioritizes movement over perfection, understanding that:

1. **It's impossible to steer a stationary ship** - You can only adjust your course when you're already in motion
2. **Iteration creates accelerated learning** - You learn from real-world feedback rather than mental models
3. **Perfect preparation is a myth** - Starting with just 20% preparation and improving as you go is far more effective

Hudson emphasizes that this is about "prioritizing pace over perfection." The pace matters because it accelerates learning and allows for course correction.

The primary obstacle to adopting this mindset is the fear of making mistakes publicly. Most people remain stuck in endless research and preparation out of this fear. As the ancient philosopher Epictetus advised, "If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid."

## Habit 2: Embracing Negative Emotions (Fall in Love with Emotional States)

This habit forms the core of Hudson's teachings and represents his most radical departure from conventional success advice. According to Hudson, what truly holds people back isn't the fear of failure itself, but rather the fear of the internal emotional experience that failure might trigger.

> "If I told you, 'Hey, you're gonna make a whole bunch of mistakes in your business, but at the end of the day, you're not going to care. You're going to feel great about every mistake you made,' then making a mistake is not such a problem."

This aversion to negative emotions is rooted in biology. Hudson explains:

> "We have a structure in our brain called the habenula... it says, 'You failed. I don't want you to fail again.' Because if I'm a tiger and I just fought for dominance and I've lost, I shouldn't go fight for dominance again."

The habenula serves as an anti-reward center in the brain, suppressing dopamine (the motivation molecule) after negative experiences. While this was useful for survival, it's counterproductive for modern success that requires risk-taking.

Hudson's breakthrough insight is that **the resistance to emotions, not the emotions themselves, creates the discomfort**:

> "Sadness feels very different if you don't want to be sad and you're sad, than if you want to be sad and you're sad. They're very different experiences."

The solution isn't avoiding these emotions but fundamentally changing our relationship with them:

1. **Get curious about the emotion** - "Where exactly is it? How high is it? How low is it? How dense is it?"
2. **Recognize each emotion's signal** - "If you're angry, it probably means there's a boundary. If you're anxious, it means there's probably some way you're not caring for yourself."
3. **Stop resisting** - "It's the resistance that makes it a really heavy experience."

Hudson shares his personal revelation: "All my bad habits are resisting an emotional experience... All my bad decisions are based on trying not to feel a certain way."

## Habit 3: The Enjoyment Compass (Efficiency Through Enjoyment)

Using the analogy of a car, Hudson distinguishes between speed (how quickly you move from A to B) and efficiency (how little fuel you use). Top performers optimize for efficiency, not just speed. This leads to Hudson's First Law:

> "Enjoyment equals efficiency."

Rather than seeing efficiency as "getting tasks done quickly," successful people recognize that enjoying the process creates true efficiency because:

1. **You'll naturally want to continue** - Enjoyment creates energy instead of depleting it
2. **You'll think more creatively** - "How do I make the most out of this? How do I move it two steps forward instead of one?"
3. **You'll attract more talent** - "People want to hang out with other people who are enjoying themselves"

Hudson applies this principle in organizational settings by tracking enjoyment as a diagnostic tool:

> "I'm right now working in one of the Alphabet companies and we're making it so that every person in the company has to say how much they enjoy a meeting at the end of the meeting... What this is doing is it shows every place where people aren't happy, where the inefficiencies are."

The key insight is that enjoyment isn't about what you do but how you do it. With creativity, almost any activity can be made more enjoyable.

## Habit 4: Eliminate "Shoulds" (The Anti-Discipline Method)

Most people try to motivate themselves through willpower, obligation, or an internal "should" monologue. However, Hudson teaches that this approach creates enormous internal friction and often backfires:

> "If you force anything, counterforce happens... When we try to force someone to do something, whether they're a 2-year-old or whether they're somebody from a different political party, there is a resistance to it."

This resistance wastes tremendous energy—it's "dirty fuel" compared to the clean fuel of genuine desire.

When faced with things we feel we "should" do but don't want to do, Hudson recommends:

1. **Question whether it truly needs to be done** - Many "shoulds" aren't actually necessary
2. **Reframe from obligation to choice** - "I don't actually have to do anything, but I'm choosing to do this because I don't want to face the consequences"
3. **Eliminate the word "should"** from your vocabulary - "Should is a motivation killer"

To demonstrate this, Hudson suggests an experiment: Say "You should brush your teeth" repeatedly for a minute and notice how you feel. Then say "I really want to brush my teeth" repeatedly and notice the difference. The "should" language depletes energy, while "want" language generates it.

When asked about duty and obligation, Hudson challenges the notion that these are separate from desire:

> "If you're going to tell me about obligation, then I would say break down what you're actually obligated to do. Is your obligation to show up to your mom for Christmas or is your obligation to have a great relationship with your mom?"

By finding the genuine desire beneath obligation, we eliminate the internal friction that drains our energy.

## Habit 5: Escape Time Poverty (Make Time Your Ally)

Most people operate with a "time poverty mentality"—constantly feeling rushed, reacting to urgent demands, and working against the clock. Top performers cultivate a different relationship with time:

> "They have a very different mentality where they're not working for time anymore, but time is working for them."

This means:

1. **Planting seeds for the future** - Focusing on actions today that will bloom in months or years
2. **Thinking strategically** - "What's the one, two, or three things I can do that will make everything on this to-do list go away or far easier to do?"
3. **Investing in compounding skills** - "If you learn how to be a better speaker or if you learn how to be in touch with your emotions... all of those things are going to pay off for the rest of your career."

This approach follows the military principle that "slow is steady, steady is fast." By shifting from reacting to immediate demands toward strategic action, you achieve greater impact with less frantic effort.

## Summary

Joe Hudson's teachings on success reveal that the conventional approaches of discipline, willpower, and "shoulding" ourselves may be counterproductive. Instead, the top 0.1% of performers:

1. **Adopt an iterative mindset** that prioritizes movement over perfection, allowing them to learn and adapt quickly
2. **Embrace their emotions** rather than resisting them, developing a healthier relationship with both positive and negative internal states
3. **Use enjoyment as their compass**, recognizing that enjoyment equals efficiency and leads to higher-quality work
4. **Eliminate "shoulds"** from their vocabulary, transforming external and internal obligations into genuine desires
5. **Escape time poverty** by making time their ally through strategic thinking and planting seeds for future growth

These habits may seem counterintuitive to those raised on conventional wisdom about success, but they represent a more sustainable and fulfilling path to extraordinary achievement. Rather than pushing through resistance, top performers find ways to align their internal states with their goals, creating flow rather than friction.
