# How Three Teenagers Built Million-Dollar Businesses on Roblox

## Overview

In a fascinating dive into an often overlooked digital economy, Pat Walls of Starter Story spent 24 hours with three young entrepreneurs who have built million-dollar businesses around Roblox, a gaming platform that many adults may dismiss as merely a children's game. Cole, his twin brother Ian, and their friend Jake have each created thriving businesses that generate between $25,000 to $70,000 monthly by tapping into Roblox's massive user base of 400 million monthly active users. Their stories reveal not just the immense financial opportunity of this platform, but also practical business wisdom that defies their young age and lack of formal education.

## Understanding the Roblox Economy

Before diving into their individual businesses, it's important to understand what makes Roblox such a fertile ground for entrepreneurship:

- **Massive Scale**: One in two kids under 16 in the US plays Roblox daily, with 400 million monthly active users worldwide.
- **Engagement**: Children spend twice as much time on Roblox as they do on TikTok, with many using TikTok primarily to discover new Roblox games.
- **Platform Model**: Roblox functions like "YouTube for video games," where anyone can create and monetize content.
- **Growing Demographic**: The platform continues to expand beyond its core audience, with new games capturing previously untapped demographics.
- **Mainstream Recognition**: Major influencers like Mr. Beast are now entering the platform, signaling its growing importance.

## Cole's Game Development Business

Cole has created one of the top 100 games on Roblox called "Hide or Die" which has about 1 million daily active users. At the time of the interview, the game had 13,000 concurrent players.

### Business Model and Revenue
- Generates approximately $45,000 monthly from just the "Hide or Die" game
- On track to make $70,000 in the month of the interview
- Revenue comes primarily through in-game purchases using Roblox's currency (Robux)
- Conversion rate: 1 million Robux equals approximately $3,500

### Success Framework
Cole shared his formula for creating a successful Roblox game:

1. **Clickability**: The game needs an attention-grabbing title and concept
2. **Social Engagement**: The game must be designed for playing with or against friends
3. **Replayability**: Players should have reasons to return (progression systems, unlockables)

### Lessons from Failure
Before his success, Cole spent:
- Three years developing a game that ultimately failed
- Approximately $300,000 on failed projects

His key insight: "Test first and then build, don't build then test. You can waste years building a startup or a game, and then it ends up being worth nothing."

## Ian's Game Development Business

Ian, Cole's twin brother, created a game initially called "Bake the Baby" (later renamed "Bathe the Baby") that went viral and allowed him to drop out of college.

### Business Model and Revenue
- Earns around $25,000 monthly from his game
- Has approximately 150,000 daily active users
- Average revenue per paying user is about $1.50
- Makes money primarily through selling in-game items and currencies

His game gained significant traction when popular YouTube and Roblox influencers like "Speed" played it, generating around 100 million views across various content creators.

## Jake's Marketing Agency

Unlike the twins who focus on game development, Jake built a marketing agency called Vector 3 that specializes in creating promotional content for brands entering the Roblox ecosystem.

### Business Model and Revenue
- Generates $36,150+ monthly revenue
- $20,000-$25,000 comes from retainer clients
- Additional revenue from project-based work
- Operating costs of $10,000-$15,000 monthly (primarily for staff)

### Client Acquisition Strategy
Jake built his client pipeline through:
- Educational content on LinkedIn that established his authority
- Paid consulting calls that often convert into implementation projects
- No cold outreach or cold calling

### Operational Excellence
Jake has systematized his business through:
- A 45-step project plan template for each type of deliverable
- SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) with video instructions for each step
- Remote team management through Discord and custom project management systems

## Their Daily Reality: Less Glamorous Than You'd Think

Despite their financial success, the trio described a surprisingly normal daily routine:

- Wake up late, often minutes before team meetings
- Work in focused 4-5 hour blocks
- Spend evenings relaxing and socializing with each other
- Maintain a clear boundary between work time and rest time

They emphasize the importance of creating space for thinking and ideation, challenging the "hustle 24/7" startup culture. As Jake explained, "Creating the space for you to have thoughts will make you a 10x better entrepreneur."

## Building Their Community

One of the most valuable aspects of their success is their friendship and support network. They shared how they built these relationships:

- Started with scheduled weekly calls (literally putting conversations on Google Calendar)
- Were willing to embrace initial awkwardness
- Maintained clear boundaries between business and friendship
- Created genuine relationships rather than transactional ones

## Summary

The key insights from these young Roblox entrepreneurs include:

1. **Platform Opportunity**: Roblox represents an enormous business opportunity that's still growing, with 400 million monthly active users and expanding demographics.

2. **Test-First Mentality**: Cole's experience highlights the importance of testing concepts quickly rather than spending years building something without market validation.

3. **Clickable, Social, Replayable**: Successful Roblox games need to capture attention, encourage social interaction, and give players reasons to return.

4. **Business Models Beyond Development**: While creating games is one path, there are adjacent opportunities like Jake's marketing agency for those with different skills.

5. **Systems and Processes**: Despite their youth, these entrepreneurs have created sophisticated business systems that allow them to scale.

6. **Community Importance**: Finding like-minded peers was crucial to their success and well-being.

7. **Balance Over Hustle**: They reject the notion that entrepreneurial success requires constant grinding, instead emphasizing the value of rest and thinking time.

What's particularly striking about these young entrepreneurs is their maturity in approaching business. Without formal business education, they've intuitively discovered principles that many seasoned entrepreneurs take years to learn: test before building, systematize operations, find your community, and maintain work-life boundaries.

For anyone looking to build a business—in gaming or otherwise—their stories offer valuable insights about identifying opportunities in emerging platforms and building sustainable businesses that don't sacrifice personal well-being.
