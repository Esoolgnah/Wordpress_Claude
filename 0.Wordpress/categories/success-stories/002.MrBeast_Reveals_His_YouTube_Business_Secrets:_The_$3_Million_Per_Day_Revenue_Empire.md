## Video Production Process

MrBeast detailed his video production process:

### Idea Generation

- Maintains a constant "information diet" for inspiration
- Employs a dedicated team to collect interesting ideas and information globally
- Develops new content ideas through diverse stimuli

### Planning and Preparation

- All main channel videos are planned through the end of the year
- Large-scale projects begin preparation months in advance
- Example: For the "hotel comparison" video, researching hotels worldwide and coordinating schedules

### Filming

- Complex filming setups (using up to 60 cameras for a single video)
- Recording important moments with time codes for the editing team
- Building massive sets and infrastructure

### Editing Process

- Re-editing each video 5-7 times to achieve the best result

### Thumbnails and Titles

- Creating 7 different versions for a single thumbnail
- Investing days in titles and thumbnails
- Maintaining style consistency for viewer recognition (e.g., hairstyle)

## Work-Life Balance

MrBeast shared his unique work approach:

- Working intensely when inspired rather than following a set schedule
- Typically working 12-15 hours daily for 7-10 consecutive days, then taking half a day to a full day off when burned out
- Living in his studio to maintain complete focus on work
- "If I'm not creating, I feel depressed and like I'm losing my sense of purpose," he expressed

He emphasized that he doesn't recommend his work style to others: "I wouldn't recommend someone do what I do because it's stressful."

## Team Management

MrBeast, who currently employs approximately 150-200 full-time employees, also discussed team management:

- Decided to hire his first employee when he started making $20-30K monthly
- Started with a helper for moving items, then gradually expanded to editors, cameramen, etc.
- Has hired about one person monthly for the past six years
- Helps employees transition to other YouTubers or companies when letting them go

He stressed that "the channel is still my creative vision," explaining that complete outsourcing is impossible.

## Future Plans

MrBeast shared the following business expansion plans:

1. **Creating Better Videos**: The foundation of everything is producing top-quality content
2. **Mobile Game Development**: Building on the success of his gaming channel and Finger on the App
3. **Expanding Feastables**: Planning to launch cookies and other new product lines
4. **Physical Beast Burger Locations**: Moving from 2,000 virtual restaurants to physical stores

## Inspiration and Role Models

MrBeast named Steve Jobs as his most admired figure:

- Inspired by Jobs' relentless passion and focus on creating the best products
- Taking the perspective that "there's never been a perfect human" and only emulating positive aspects
- Applying Jobs' "product line reduction and laser-like focus" to his videos

## The Future of YouTube

MrBeast shared an optimistic outlook on the YouTube platform:

- "In 10 years, YouTube will have a bigger cultural impact than television ever did"
